I am trying to open an installed android mobile application via html page in Chrome browser through javascript or jQuery click function.

It seems an anchor tag tap is working fine and opening an installed app but it's not allowing when I am trying to open an app with javascript click function, href is same still it's not working.

Here is the code:

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>  
<script src="assets/js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <a id="openApp" href="intent://adjustify/#Intent;scheme=https;package=com.pazar.pazarEats;end">click me 65</a>
</body>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function(){
            setTimeout(function(){
                document.getElementById('openApp').click();
            }, 2000);
        });
    </script>
</html>
